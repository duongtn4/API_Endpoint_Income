# API_Endpoint_Income
Building rest API for Income Prediction
Using UCIâ€™s Census Income dataset, I conducted data cleaning and exploratory and trained ML models (Random Forest and Logistic Regressions) to predict Income for test data.
After that I built API for predicting the result from my best ML model. My endpoint will take the input data in the test dataset (single row of data or a batch) and return the predictions.
